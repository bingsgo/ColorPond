About
-----

I made this project for two reasons

1. I wanted to learn about HTML5 Canvas in a fun and exciting way
2. I have always had an intrest in "Virtual Life", and wondered if I could accomplish something simple

I plan to keep on working on this indefinitely. I have MANY MANY ideas on how to move forward and I will try to document them below



TODO LIST
=========

- ~~Implement data crunching in a web-worker seperate from ui thread~~
- Improve
- Implement aggressive organisms
- Implement a more realistic "flow", aka currents and whirlpools
- Optimization of the Consumer Pathfinding algorithm
- Create proper objects to represent the Pond, Resources, Materials, and the Organisms
